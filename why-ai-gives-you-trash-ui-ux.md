# A developer told me AI keeps giving him trash UI/UX. 

Mine? Outstanding. 

𝗦𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗹𝘆 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘀. Why?

The longer we talked, the clearer the answer became.

**TL;DR: It’s not the model. It’s your approach.**

Like my colleague, most people use AI like this:

1️⃣ They explain 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝘄𝗮𝗻𝘁 and let AI do it.  
2️⃣ Or they explain what they want and tell AI 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗼 𝗱𝗼 𝗶𝘁.

Even if they don’t actually know what they want, let alone how to get it done.

Unfortunately, AI is a people-pleaser; It works hard to give you precisely what you ask for, even when that means compromising accuracy, quality, and integrity.

And AI is not a mind reader. If you don’t actually understand the craft behind the task, your guidance can actually make the output worse!

When it comes to my developer friend, he doesn't speak in terms of kerning, hierarchy, user flows, wireframes . . . So how can he expect AI to produce precise, professional-grade output from imprecise, non-expert instructions?

He can’t. You can't. None of us can.

But you 𝙘𝙖𝙣 collaborate.

## Before you hit “generate,” ask:

**"Am I actually qualified to direct this work?"**

Your answer will shape:

1. How much direction you give.  
2. What kind of language you use.  
3. When to lead vs. when to explore.

---

## If your expertise is limited, I recommend:

✔️ Start with a 30/70 direction-to-exploration ratio (or even 10/90 if you're new). This keeps you from over-directing beyond your expertise.

✔️ Plan with AI before producing anything, and use several models (e.g. GPT and Claude Code for strategy and technical planning, Perplexity for research etc.).

✔️ Ask more questions than you answer. Use AI as a learning partner to clarify goals, constraints, and requirements (and to strengthen your prompts).

✔️ Produce a draft with AI using what you've learned.

✔️ Then have AI critique your work as an expert in the field. Use a custom GPT or niche expert model for more targeted feedback.

This alone will dramatically improve the quality of your outputs.

✔️ And, if you can, bring in a human expert for the final pass. Even if your results improve (they will), your ability to evaluate quality is still limited by your own understanding. If you don’t know what “good” looks like, you can’t reliably identify it.

AI isn’t a genie. It’s a collaborator.

Just like working with people, you must learn how to communicate clearly, use the correct language, and know not just what to say… but what not to say.
